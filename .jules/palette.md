# Palette's Journal

## 2024-01-01 - [Initial Entry]
**Learning:** Initialized Palette's journal.
**Action:** Will record critical UX/a11y learnings here.

## 2024-05-23 - [Blocking Alerts Replacement]
**Learning:** Native `alert()` calls for access control disrupt flow and feel unprofessional.
**Action:** Replaced with `toast.error` (react-hot-toast) using an icon (🔒) to convey meaning instantly without blocking interaction. Established `Toaster` in `App.tsx` as a foundation for future notifications.
