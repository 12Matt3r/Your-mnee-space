## 2024-05-22 - Button Component Standardization
**Learning:** When refactoring to use shared components (like `Button`), respect the design system's default styles but use `className` overrides carefully. For Tailwind components with gradients (`bg-gradient-to-r`), overriding with a flat color (`bg-blue-500`) requires unsetting the background image (`bg-none`) or, better yet, overriding the gradient stops (`from-blue-500 to-blue-600`) to maintain the "shiny" aesthetic while changing the hue.
**Action:** When migrating legacy buttons to the shared `Button` component, check if the original button used a specific color. If so, apply the corresponding gradient stops via `className` to preserve the visual identity while gaining the component's features (loading states, accessibility).
