# YourSpace Roadmap

## The Journey: What It Was → What It Is → What It Could Be

## What It Was: The Origin Story

YourSpace started as a vision to bring back what made early social platforms magical—**true creative ownership**—while leveraging modern technology that didn't exist in the MySpace era.

### The Problem We Saw
- **Artists are fragmented** across 10+ platforms, each taking a cut
- **No platform lets you truly customize** your digital presence anymore
- **Discovery is broken**—algorithms favor engagement over artistry
- **Monetization is extractive**—platforms take 30-50% of creator earnings
- **Collaboration is siloed**—no unified space where artists can create together

### Initial Concept (v0.1)
- Basic profile pages with customization
- Content upload system
- Simple social features

---

## What It Is: Current State (v1.0)

A fully functional creative platform with:

### Core Features Live
- **Swipe-based artist discovery** (Tinder for talent)
- **Customizable profiles** with widget system and themes
- **3D Virtual Rooms** where artists can showcase work in immersive spaces
- **Multi-format content support** (audio, video, images, 3D models, code)
- **Real-time collaboration infrastructure**
- **Social features** (follows, likes, comments, collections)
- **Discord integration** for community building
- **EPK Builder** for professional press kits

### Technical Foundation
- React + TypeScript + Vite (modern, fast, maintainable)
- Supabase backend (auth, database, storage, edge functions)
- Tailwind CSS with custom theme system
- 3D room rendering with Three.js
- Real-time capabilities via Supabase Realtime

### Database Ready For Scale
- 15+ tables covering profiles, content, collaborations, transactions
- Row Level Security for data protection
- Optimized queries with proper indexing
